# melaniemcd-ai

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. I publish it primarily for transparency, to share implementation notes and patterns I am exploring, and to intentionally stretch my development skills, including becoming more fluent with tools like GitHub.

## Development tools

This project is developed using a mix of AI-assisted and traditional tools, including Codex, Cursor, and Replit. I use these tools intentionally to accelerate learning, explore modern workflows, and iterate quickly while keeping the codebase understandable.

## Disclaimer

This is a personal portfolio codebase, published for learning and reflection, not as a reusable template or maintained package.

Some experiments reference publicly available data or materials from municipal websites, particularly from the City of Lebanon, New Hampshire, where I work and reside. All such data remain the property of their respective public sources and are used here solely for demonstration or educational purposes.

The interpretations, analyses, and opinions expressed are entirely my own and do not represent any official city or town position.
